# Machine Learning for Structural Analysis of Drugs that Permeate the Blood-Brain Barrier

## Created By: Christian Garvin, Kush Gulati, and Jamie Wang
***

We are interested in developing a qualitative model to classify whether a molecule is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) while improving our chemical understanding of what types of molecules can do so effectively.
